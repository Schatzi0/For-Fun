Step-1:
Run a script with root privileges
sudo nano /etc/rc.local

Step-2:
Type the command that we want to execute automatically during boot-up, in my case:-

#! /bin/bash
sudo mount -t fuse.vmhgfs-fuse .host:/ /mnt/hgfs -o allow_other
exit 0


Anything b/w the #! /bin/bash & exit 0 will execute at start-up we can add more command after the 1st one that we want to start during boot

Now we have to make the file executable:
sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local








The rc.local script in some Linux distributions and Unix systems is a superuser startup script, usually located under the directory /etc/etc/rc.d. The file name rc refers to Run Control.
 It is important to remember /etc/rc.local is discontinued and replaced.
